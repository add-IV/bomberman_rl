# Hardware

For the DQN and MCTS approaches, we first started prototyping on our local machines. After the initial prototyping we switched to Google Colab for training the models since non of our team members had cuda graphics cards. To that end we would run the game on our local machines and save the games. After some preprocessing where we extracted the features and the rewards from the games, we uploaded the data to Google Colab and trained the models there. Especially for the MCTS, where playing the game itself is computationally expensive, this approach was very helpful.
