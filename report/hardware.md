# Hardware

For the DQN and MCTS approaches, we first started prototyping on our local machines. After the initial prototyping, we switched to Google Colab to train the models since none of our team members had Cuda graphics cards. To that end, we would run the game on our local machines and save the games. After some preprocessing, in which we extracted the features and the rewards from the games, we uploaded the data to Google Colab and trained the models there. This approach was very helpful, especially for the MCTS, where playing the game itself is computationally expensive.
