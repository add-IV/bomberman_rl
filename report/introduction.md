# Introduction

## Motivation

Video Games have been used to test and develop Machine Learning algorithms for a long time. They provide a controlled environment that has a well defined objective as well as well define inputs. The results are also visual and easy to interpret and compare. This makes them a great tool for testing and developing different algorithms. Bomberman is a game that requires pathfinding, obstacle destruction, and PvP combat, which allows for a wide range of strategies to be tested. This makes it a great game to test different Machine Learning algorithms.

## Challenges

Bomberman as a game provides these challenges:

- **Navigating the map:**
    The agent must be able to navigate the map, both to pathfind to targets and to avoid obstacles and other agents.
- **Picking up coins:**
    The agent must be able to pick up coins to increase its score. This also include planning to blow up crates to potentially reveal coins.
- **Surviving:**
    The agent must be able to survive, which includes avoiding bombs and other agents.
- **Defeating opponents:**
    The agent must be able to defeat opponents, by blowing them up and trapping them.
- **Balancing exploration and exploitation:**
    The agent must be able to balance exploration and exploitation, since it must learn to play the game while playing it.
- **Handling uncertainty:**
    The agent must be able to act under a high level of uncertainty, since both where coins appear and what actions other agents will take are not known in advance.
- **Efficiency:**
    The agent must be able to act quickly, since the game has a time limit for each move, as well as the restriction that the agent will be run on a CPU.
- **Training time:**
    The agent must be able to learn quickly, since the deadline for the project provides a constraint on training time.

These challenges make Bomberman a great game to test different Machine Learning algorithms, since it requires a wide range of strategies to be successful.
