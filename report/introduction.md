# Introduction

## Motivation

Video Games have long been used to test and develop machine-learning algorithms. They provide a controlled environment with a well-defined objective and inputs. The results are also visual and easy to interpret and compare, making them a great tool for testing and developing different algorithms. Bomberman is a game that requires pathfinding, obstacle destruction, and PvP combat, which allows for a wide range of strategies to be tested. This makes it a great game to test different Machine Learning algorithms.

## Challenges

Bomberman as a game provides these challenges:

- **Navigating the map:**
 The agent must be able to navigate the map to find targets and avoid obstacles and other agents.
- **Picking up coins:**
 To increase its score, the agent must be able to pick up coins. This includes planning to blow up crates to potentially reveal coins.
- **Surviving:**
 The agent must be able to survive, which includes avoiding bombs and other agents.
- **Defeating opponents:**
 The agent must be able to defeat opponents by blowing them up and trapping them.
- **Balancing exploration and exploitation:**
 The agent must be able to balance exploration and exploitation since it must learn to play the game while playing it.
- **Handling uncertainty:**
 The agent must be able to act under high uncertainty since both where coins appear and what actions other agents will take are not known in advance.
- **Efficiency:**
 The agent must be able to act quickly since the game has a time limit for each move and the restriction that the agent will be run on a CPU.
- **Training time:**
 The agent must be able to learn quickly since the project deadline constrains training time.

These challenges make Bomberman a great game for testing different Machine Learning algorithms since it requires a wide range of strategies to be successful.
